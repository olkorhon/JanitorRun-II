I felt content
I felt skilful
I was interested in the game's story
I thought it was fun
I was fully occupied with the game
I felt happy
It gave me a bad mood
I thought about other things
I found it tiresome
I felt competent
I thought it was hard
It was aesthetically pleasing
I forgot everything around me
I felt good
I was good at it
I felt bored
I felt successful
I felt imaginative
I felt that I could explore things
I enjoyed it
I was fast at reaching the game's targets
I felt annoyed
I felt pressured
I felt irritable
I lost track of time
I felt challenged
I found it impressive
I was deeply concentrated in the game
I felt frustrated
It felt like a rich experience
I lost connection with the outside world
I felt time pressure
I had to put a lot of effort into it

I felt revived
I felt bad
I found it hard to get back to reality
I felt guilty
It felt like a victory
I found it a waste of time
I felt energised
I felt satisfied
I felt disoriented
I felt exhausted
I felt that I could have done more useful things
I felt powerful
I felt weary
I felt regret
I felt ashamed
I felt proud
I had a sense that I had returned from a journey
